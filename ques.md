## exploration of new interview questions 🔐🔐🔐🔐


## blockchain ?
```bash 
ledger that is distributed,immutable and decentralized where all transaction are protected by cryptographic algorithm.
```
## principle on which blockchain tech is based on ? 
```bash
based on distributed ledger technology which aims to provide a single source of truth being distributed across network.
```
## types of blockchain network 
```bash 
* public : bitcoin,ethereum
** private : Ripple (XRP), ,multichain,locks tax,
** consortium : Hyperledger
```
## is there any restriction in types of records in blockchain ?
```bash
no
```
## Blockchain vs traditional database 
```bash 
Blockchain : decentralized....can perform only insert operation....work on peer to peer network...no single point of failure...
traditional database : centralized....can perform CRUD operation....master-slave concept...single point failure exists....
```
## key features of blockchain 
```bash
* decentralized
* distributed 
* immutability 
* safety
* concept of mining
```
## encryption ? and its role in blockchain 
```bash 
keeping the data safe...by cryptographic algorithm, concept of public and private key....so to provide authenticity. 
```
## what is block ? 
```bash
blockcahin consists of a list of records/transaction...and that records are stored in blocks... 
```
## what are blocks identifiers ?
```bash 
* block header hash(which is generated from merkle tree) 
* block height (no of blocks in blockchain )
```
## possible to modify data in blockchain ?
```bash
impossible to modify data in that contract....
```
## how does a block is recognised in the blockchain approach ?
```bash 
>> hash
>> transaction data
>> timestamp
```
## is it possible to remove one or more blocks from network in blockchain ?
```bash
no, it can't be done....all are linked so if one block is removed then the chain will break
```
## security of blocks ??
```bash 
* entire blockchain is protected by cryptographic algorithm...
* each block has unique hash pointer, so any modification will change in others too(that will break the chain) so security is tight here.
* also consensus algorithm works here to validate record and to keep it in blocks....Consensus algos : pow,pos,poa, etc

```
## concept of merkle tree ...
```bash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fB41w3JcR7U 

```
## ledger ? 
```bash 
where transaction are recorded . 
```
## centralized, distributed and decentralized systems
```bash
Centralized : that use client/server architecture where one or more client nodes are directly connected to a central server.
Distributed : it doesn’t have a single central owner...users have equal access to data, though user privileges can be enabled 
               when needed.The best example of a vast, distributed system is the internet itself.
Decentralized :  decentralized systems don’t have one central owner. Instead, they use multiple central owners,
                   each of which usually stores a copy of the resources users can access.
 
 💪 Fault tolerance:
Low: Centralized systems
Moderate: Decentralized systems
High: Distributed systems

🔧 Maintenance:
Low: Centralized systems
Moderate: Decentralized systems
High: Distributed systems

🚀 Scalability:
Low: Centralized systems
Moderate: Decentralized systems
High: Distributed systems

```
## mining ?? 
```bash 
process of transaction verification to keep that record in block..
```
## components of blockchain ecosystem 
```bash
* Shared ledger 
* virtual machine 
* node application
* consensus algorithm 

```
## pow vs pos 
```bash 
pow : where miners use high computational computer resources to validate..consume more energy...miners receive block rewards 
pos : stakeholders validate new blocks by utilizing the share of coin...consume less energy....validaters receive transaction fee as reward.

```
## is double spending possible in blockchain ? 
```bash
no....
The Double Spend Problem describes the difficulty of ensuring digital money is not easily duplicated.
the blockchain prevents double-spending by timestamping groups of transactions and then broadcasting them to all of the nodes in the bitcoin network
```
## examples of blockchain application developing platforms
```bash
====>>> ethereum, iota, cardano, hyperledger fabric
```
## 
```bash
* there is no concept of mining in private blockchains. coz nodes are pre-defined initially  
* blockchain saves time and cost too. coz if compare visa speed with solana blockchain ..then solana's speed is on moon.
```
## widely used cryptographic algorithm ?
```bash
* RSA
* AES
* Blowfish 
* Twofish
```
## concept of forking and its types 
```bash
** what happens when a blockchain diverges into two potential paths forward.
** a situation that occurs when two or more blocks have the same block height.
types : hard fork (where old rule is invalid now )
        soft fork (backward compatible )

fork results splitting ethereum into  Ethereum and Ethereum Classic...
          and bitcoin to bitcoin and bitcoin cash..
```
## blind signature
```bash

```
## secret spiltting/sharing
```bash
message/data will be splitted and transferred to trusted parties/nodes....and later on , if we need to retrieve data , we need to collect data from all nodes and it need to be integrated......splitted data is of no use until integration. 
```
## off-chain transaction
```bash

```
## anonymity and pseudonymity 
```bash
example od anonymity : Zcash (no trackdown of transaction,enhanced privacy for its users)
pseudonymity : for long term relation 
```
## how does peer discovery work in p2p network ? 
```bash

```
## what is 51% attack ? 
```bash

```
## durability and robustness ? 
```bash

```
## transparent and incorruptable ? 
```bash

```
## how does bitcoin use blockchain ? 
```bash

```
## how does NFTs use blockchain ?  
```bash

```
## business benefits of blockchain 
```bash

```
## 3 trilemma of blockchain ? 
```bash
>>>> decentralization, security and scalability  
```
## how do you stay upto date with the new and upcoming concept of blockchain ? 
```bash
==>> we can check new/trending coins in coinmarketcap & marketcal , and then we can do research what they are solving/doing in this blockchain field and so on...
==>> joining conference ...
==>> reading blogs/articles of coinmarketcap, tradingview,coingecko and marketcal. 
```
## nonce ? 
```bash

```
## process of blockchain mining ? 
```bash
* transaction....to mempool 
* solve mathematical problem 
* miners solved the problem first 
* miners verify the validity 
* block is added 
```
