## a quick look to interview questions 
```bash 
Collection taken from Blockchain interns (from codeeater)
** data structures concepts
** merkle tree idea
** solidity all a to z 
** btc,eth backgrounds 
** defi concepts,implementaions
** suppose u have 5 ether in your address,then write a smart contract which can
     transfer your certain eth to your next a/c after a ertain timestamp.
**  hashes 
** Cryptography  ..asym, symm.
**  DAO
** infura,hardahat,truffle,
** moralis, ipfs ====> basic concepts 
** Ipfs working 
** Decentralized vs distributed 
**

## exploration of new interview questions ðŸ¦–

## blockchain ?
```bash 
ledger that is distributed,immutable and decentralized where all transaction are protected by cryptographic algorithm.
```
## principle on which blockchain tech is based on ? 
```bash
based on distributed ledger technology which aims to provide a single source of truth being distributed across network.
```
## types of blockchain network 
```bash 
* public : bitcoin,ethereum
** private : Ripple (XRP), ,multichain,locks tax,
** consortium : Hyperledger
```
## is there any restriction in types of records in blockchain ?
```bash
no
```
## Blockchain vs traditional database 
```bash 
Blockchain : decentralized....can perform only insert operation....work on peer to peer network 
traditional database : centralized....can perform CRUD operation....master-slave concept 
```
## key features of blockchain 
```bash
* decentralized
* distributed 
* immutability 
* safety
* concept of mining
```
## encryption ? and its role in blockchain 
```bash 
by cryptographic algorithm, concept of public and private key....so to provide authenticity. 
```
## what is block ? 
```bash
blockcahin consists of a list of records/transaction...and that records are stored in blocks... 
```
## what are blocks identifiers ?
```bash 
* block header hash(which is generated from merkle tree) 
* block height (no of blocks in blockchain )
```
## possible to modify data in blockchain ?
```bash
impossible to modify data in that contract....
